# campus-crush
A text-based romance game made after following FCC's tutorial called **Campus Crush** <sub>(wish i thought of a more inventive name)</sub>

This project ended up taking longer than expected only because I kept adding more and more things to it purely out of curiousity. I decided today I'm going to stop adding features and just upload it and start work on something else haha I want to try my hand at making something like this again but with a proper narrative system and sprites and all! For now, I am satisfied with my first attempt~

## What I changed
- the entire concept of the game
- (kind of) added a narrative system
- added an inventory to the DOM
- added a gifting system
- added a cooldown system
- layout/design

I learned a lot from this project and so far, it was the most fun I had coding ðŸ˜„ specifically: switch/case, the setTimeout method, and more about editing the DOM dynamically with javascript
